# Argo CD

## How Argo CD Works

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Git Repository"
        A[K8s Manifest Files<br/>Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, etc.]
    end
    
    subgraph "Kubernetes Cluster"
        B[Argo CD Controller]
        C[Application Resources]
        D[Pods & Services]
    end
    
    subgraph "Developer Workflow"
        E[Developer Commits Changes]
    end

    B -->|Polls every 3min<br/>or Webhook| A
    B -->|Compares| C
    B -->|Syncs & Applies| C
    C -->|Creates/Updates| D
    
    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style B fill:#fff4e1
    style C fill:#e8f5e9
    style D fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Workflow Steps:**

1. Developer commits and pushes changes to Git repository
2. Argo CD controller monitors Git repository (polling or webhook)
3. Argo CD compares desired state (Git) with actual state (cluster)
4. Argo CD automatically syncs and applies changes to cluster
5. Kubernetes creates/updates resources based on manifests


Use Argo CD to sync git repository changes to Kubernetes cluster:

- Deployments (applications, microservices)
- Services (types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- Ingresses (routing rules, TLS, etc.)
- Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs / storage)
- Work Flow Template (Argo Workflows)
- Config Maps (key-value pairs)
- Secrets (tokens, passwords, ssh keys, etc.)

To K8S cluster.

## [Introduction](https://youtu.be/2WSJF7d8dUg)

### Install Argo

```shell
kubectl create namespace argocd
```

Option 1: Command

```shell
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
```shell
kubectl -n argocd apply -f ./install.yaml
```

Option 2: Save as file

It's better because then manifest won't change if there is new update and also you would be able to see if there is any suspicious info in the yaml content.

```shell
curl -o install.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

Check pods

```shell
kubectl -n argocd get pods
```

Output

Controller plane = Looks after all `kind: Application` values and will automatically sync with Argo API/CLI server.

API server = 

```shell
NAME                                               READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
argocd-application-controller-9f66f9c54-dtf2w      1/1     Running            0          19s  <-- controller plane

argocd-repo-server-74f7d76f8b-w194q                0/1     ContainerCreating  0          18s
argocd-server-7c95d549d4-vgwrt                     0/1     Running            0          18s  <-- API server
```

[Port Forwarding](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#port-forwarding)

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

The API server can then be accessed using https://localhost:8080

```shell
kubectl apply -n argocd -f ./app.yaml
```
In argocd server GUI

- go to application tab, here you should see your newly created app.
- Check Logs for errors, image pull loop, bugs.

## [More Argo CD | Nana](https://youtu.be/MeU5_k9ssrs)

### CD workflow without Argo CD )=

CI/CD Server Example:

[test] -> [build image] -> [push to docker repo] -> [update K8s manifest file] -> [kubectl apply]

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Test] --> B[Build Image]
    B --> C[Push to Docker Repo]
    C --> D[Update K8s manifest File]
    D --> E[kubectl apply...]
    E --> F[New version deployed!]
    subgraph CI
        A --> B
    end
    subgraph CD
        D --> E
    end
    subgraph "CI / CD Server"
        C
    end
```

Challenges with this approach (configure on jenkins)

- Install and setup tools, like kubectl/helm
- configure access to K8s
- Configure access to cloud platforms
- Security challenge (Cluster credentials external services and tools)
- A lot of projects will deploy applications to the cluster. Each project need its own kubernetes credential so it can only access the specific application resources in the cluster.
- Configure credentials for each and every cluster.
- No visibility in deployment status. Example: Jenkins does not know the status of execution, was app created, healthy status, failing to start?

### CD part can be improved - with Argo CD (=

Argo CD was built for:

- continous delivery for Kubernetes Cluster (more efficient)
- Based on GitOps
- No External access (e.g. Jenkins is external)
- Internal access (Argo CD is part of K8s cluster)

How Argo CD works:

- ArgoCD agent pulls K8s manifest changes and applies them (compare to traditional: on push)

CD Workflow with ArgoCD

1. Deploy ArgoCD in K8s cluster.
2. Configure ArgoCD to track Git repository.
3. ArgoCD monitors for any changes and applies automatically.


User Commit and push source code repository

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Commit] --> B[Git repository]
    B --> C[trigger CI pipeline]
```

Jenkins CI-CD pipeline

- K8s manifest file will be updated in a separate git repo
    - e.g. Deployment.yaml will be updated in separate git repo

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Test] --> B[Build Image]
    B --> C[Push to Docker Repo]
    C --> D[Update K8s manifest File]
```

Argo CD is monitoring for changes and pulls them when out of sync

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ArgoCD is not synced] --> B[ArgoCD pull manifest]
    B --> C[ArgoCD monitor]
    C --> A
```

When updating manifest file usually the Deployment yaml file will change the version at `image: app:2.0` part.

#### Best Practice for Git Repository

-  Separate git repositories for application source code and application configuration (K8s manifest files).
- Even separate git repository for system configurations (First repo for source code and second repo for app configuration).

Why separate Git Repository?

- Not only Deployment.yaml, but also ConfigMap, Secret, Service, Ingress.

- K8s manifest files can change independent of source code.
- You don't want to trigger the full CI pipeline, when app source code has not changed while app config has.
- You don't want complex logic in CI pipeline that checks what have changed in K8s manifest.

Splitting **CI** (dev) and **CD** (ops)

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Git Repository: App Configuration"
        AppConfig[GitOps Repository]
    end
    subgraph "Git Repository: App Source Code"
        AppCode[App Source Code]
        Jenkinsfile[Jenkinsfile]
    end
```

**Git as Single Source of Truth**

Actual State (K8s) == Desired State (Git repository)

- Argo CD is keeping same K8s manifest state as based on whats specified in the desired state ('App Configuration Repository'/'GitOps Repository') Repository.
- So if a change happens in K8s State and its not same as in desired state, then Argo CD will sync with the desired state(pull from repo and update the K8s state)
- Full cluster transparency
- Guarantees that K8s manifests in Git remains single source of truth.
- Single interface.
- Version controlled changes (history of changes).
- better team collaboration.
- Easy rollback
- Cluster Disaster Recovery (Delete Old cluster and create a new one by pointing to same git repository)

Need a way to quickly update the cluster anyway?

- Configure ArgoCD to not sync manual cluster changes automatically.
  - Send alert instead

K8s manifests can be defined in different ways (works with ArgoCD)

- Kubernetes YAML files (Plane K8s YAML files).
- Helm Charts (Generated to Plane K8s YAML files).
- Kustomize - 'Kustomize.io' (Generated to Plane K8s YAML files).

#### Git Ops

ArgoCD is based on GitOps and helps implement those GitOps principles

#### K8S Access Control with Git & Argo CD

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Merge Requests"
        A[DevOps Team] --> B[Operations Team]
        B --> C[Junior Engineers]
        C --> D[Senior Engineers]
    end

    subgraph "Merge"
        E[DevOps Team] -->|❌| F[Operations Team]
        F -->|❌| G[Junior Engineers]
        G -->|❌| H[Senior Engineers]
        subgraph "Allowed"
            H --> I[Merge Successful]
        end
    end

    style E fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px
    style F fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px
    style G fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px
    style H fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px
    style A fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px
    style B fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px
    style C fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px
    style D fill:#fff,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:0px

    A --> A_ok(✅)
    B --> B_ok(✅)
    C --> C_ok(✅)
    D --> D_ok(✅)

    E --> E_not_ok(❌)
    F --> F_not_ok(❌)
    G --> G_not_ok(❌)
    H --> H_ok(✅)
```

Not everyone should have access to K8s cluster

- Configure access rules easily with Git repositories.
    - 'Merge request', 'merge' privilege (different access permission).
    - No need to create ClusterRole & user resources in Kubernetes.
    - No cluster credential outside of K8s
        - Engineers do not need access for K8s cluster.
        - Instead give engineers access to git repository.
        - No need to give external cluster access to non human users e.g. Jenkins.

#### ArgoCD as K8s extension

What does it mean?

- ArgoCD uses K8s functionalities.
    - e.g. using etcd to store data.
    - e.g. using K8s controllers for monitoring and comparing actual and desired state
- BENEFIT: Visibility in the cluster.
    - Real-time updates of application state.
        - Pods created, Healthy status.
        - Pods failing, Rollback needed.

#### How to configure ArgoCD?

1. Deploy ArgoCD into K8s cluster.

- Extends the K8s API with crd (Custom Resource Definition)

2. Configure ArgoCD with K8s YAML File.

- Main Resource is "Application"
    - application.yaml
        - Which Git repository?
        - Which K8s cluster?
    - Possible to configure multiple application for different microservices.
        - e.g: billing-app.yaml, cart-app.yaml, shipping-app.yaml, frontend-app.yaml
            - Logically group applications
              - group them in another 'crd' called app project.
        - set restrictions
            - restrict: what (git repos) may be deployed.
            - restrict: where (cluster & namespaces) apps may be deployed to

e.g. Git repository with Cluster:

```
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/argocd-app-config.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: dev
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: myapp
```

#### ArgoCD & Multi-Cluster Setups

Working with multiple clusters

- Configure and manage just 1 ArgoCD
- Same ArgoCD instance is able to sync a fleet of K8s clusters.

Working with multiple cluster environments

- development, staging, production (each environment have their own replicas).
    - In each environment we may deploy and run ArgoCD instances while still having 1 repository.
    - test app in each environment and promote to next one
        - e.g. git repository change -> ArgoCD sync with dev -> test dev -> test stage -> publish to prod

Working with multiple clusters

1. Git branch for each environment (Not as effective as second option)

2. Using overlays with kustomize (Better)
   
```
./myapp-cluster
├── base
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   ├── rbac.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
├── overlays
    ├── development
    │   └── kustomization.yaml
    ├── staging
    │   └── kustomization.yaml
    └── production
        └── kustomization.yaml
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[CI Pipeline for DEV] --> B[../development/kustomization.yaml];
    C[CI Pipeline for STAGING] --> D[../staging/kustomization.yaml];
```

Will ArgoCD replace CI/CD tools like Jenkins

- No, we still need CI pipeline to do tests, build image, push to docker registry, update K8s manifest file, etc.
- ArgoCD is an replacement for CD (Continous Delivery).

ArgoCD alternatives

- Flux CD
- JenkinsX

## Demo

prerequisitive:

- empty minikube cluster

set up fully automated CD pipeline

1. Install ArgoCD in K8s cluster

Install Argo CD

```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

Check nodes/pods status

```shell
$ kubectl get pod -n argocd
```

```conf
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
argocd-application-controller-0            1/1     Running   0          3m29s
argocd-dex-server-74454766c4-j6ccj         1/1     Running   0          3m29s
argocd-redis-5b6967fdfc-q85mq              1/1     Running   0          3m29s
argocd-repo-server-78d9fc859-6ghxr         1/1     Running   0          3m29s
argocd-server-779d76669-hkq2c              1/1     Running   0          3m29s
```

Check services

```shell
kubectl get svc -n argocd
```

```conf
NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
argocd-dex-server      ClusterIP   10.102.206.121   <none>        5556/TCP,5557/TCP,5558/TCP   3m54s
argocd-metrics         ClusterIP   10.99.85.79      <none>        8082/TCP                     3m54s
argocd-redis           ClusterIP   10.107.164.236   <none>        6379/TCP                     3m53s
argocd-repo-server     ClusterIP   10.108.145.142   <none>        8081/TCP,8084/TCP            3m53s
argocd-server          ClusterIP   10.104.30.139    <none>        80/TCP,443/TCP               3m53s
argocd-server-metrics  ClusterIP   10.103.55.117    <none>        8083/TCP                     3m53s
```

Forward the port for argocd-server service

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n argocd svc/argocd-server 8080:443
```

```shell
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 443
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 443
```

Get login password

```shell
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: Tk12UEN1VndwUDNRV2REcQ==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2021-10-11T08:03:33Z"
  name: argocd-initial-admin-secret
  namespace: argocd
  resourceVersion: "3095"
  uid: a872d061-2eec-4383-9aaf-a4b0dc1a901c
type: Opaque
```

Decode password

```shell
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret \
  -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
```

```shell
NMvPCuVwpP3QWdDq
```

webpage: `127.0.0.1:8080`

Password = `NMvPCuVwpP3QWdDq`

- Note: password is different for everyone because its autogenerated.

Username = `admin`

- Note: username is always same if not changed.

2. Configure ArgoCD with "Application" CRD

Add [ArgoCD app configuration](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications)

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: guestbook
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: guestbook
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: guestbook

  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true

    automated:
      selfHeal: true
      prune: true
```

Note ArgoCD polls Git repository every 3 minutes

- if you dont want this delay, you can configure a Git webhook (Between git repo and ArgoCD)

```
kubectl apply -f application.yaml
```

### Login

#### GUI (website)

visit [127.0.0.1:8080](https://127.0.0.1:8080)

#### CLI 

```shell
argocd login 127.0.0.1:8080 --username admin --password "$(kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d)" --insecure
```

- check if ArgoCD is synchronized with Git the repository and cluster.

3. Test your setup by updating Deployment.yaml file

Try to e.g. increment version of the application to the latest.

What do the buttons do in ArgoCD GUI?

- REFRESH: Compare the latest code in Git with the live state.
- SYNC: Move to target state, by actually applying the changes to the K8s cluster.
